Hello! I'm Michele Mancusi, a **Senior Research Scientist** at **Sony**. My work focuses on deep learning for **generative models** in speech, audio, music and text utilizing Large Language Models (**LLMs**) and **diffusion models** to push the boundaries of what's possible in audio technology.

Before joining Sony, I gained valuable experience as an intern at **Microsoft** and **Musixmatch**. At Microsoft, I worked on deep learning for unsupervised speech separation, and at Musixmatch, I focused on deep learning for singing voice detection.

I earned my **Ph.D.** from **Sapienza University of Rome** under the supervision of **Prof. Emanuele Rodolà**. My doctoral research centered on music generation, source separation, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), contributing to advancements in the field of generative AI.
